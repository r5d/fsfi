# FSF India Board Statement

The recent statement by some members of the wider free software and
open source community to RMS re-joining the board of FSF as a member
have led to some unnecessary friction in the community. Unfortunately
many of the arguments made against him were based on misunderstanding
and half truths. More dangerous is concerted attack on RMS vilifying
him and trying to isolate him. FSF India condemns this action. There
is no freedom more important than freedom of thought and expression.

We welcome and encourage the efforts of FSF to improve their
[governance process][1] and hope that the larger free software
community will also support them in this process.

FSF India is an independent and autonomous non-profit organisation. It
continues to stand and work for the cause of free software. It is 
committed to making all its forums and programs inclusive and
promoting diversity while standing firm on the [ideals set out by
the GNU project][2].
