# Open letter to KITE: On the use of proprietary apps and services for online classes in schools

<strong>To</strong><br />
Hon' Minister for Education,<br />
Govt of Kerala.

Dear Sir

Kerala Govt has always been a leader in adoption of Free Software
(free as in freedom) in the country. Most importantly it started with
introduction of Free Software in the schools. Leadership shown by
teacher community in Kerala is also commendable.

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the adoption of online
mode of education<sup>[1](#fn-1)</sup>, we found that proprietary
software is being promoted within the educational system. We learned
that official documents by the offices under the Govt. of Kerala calls
for use of proprietary software exclusively for educational
purposes<sup>[2](#fn-2)</sup>. Promotion of proprietary software such
as WhatsApp is particularly problematic on two grounds. It is
explicitly going back from the Government's position to use Free
Software and secondly it promotes a monopoly power.


## The WhatsApp Trap

Many people do not realize the trap of WhatsApp as they only see that
the service is free of cost and everyone around them is using it. One
reason for this is their lack of understanding about the trade-offs
they are making when using WhatsApp. Most people using WhatsApp do not
realize how their data is being collected, stored and analyzed by
WhatsApp. Making our students use this software at a time when they
can not make an informed decision is like a drug dealer providing a
sample pack. The State is creating consumers for a monopoly
business. Use of WhatsApp as the channel to exchange educational
content discriminates against those who would prefer not to use
WhatsApp but other options. WhatsApp is a subsidiary of
Facebook<sup>[3](#fn-3)</sup> which is infamous for its carelessness
and complete disregard for its user's privacy<sup>[4](#fn-4)</sup>.


## Alternates available

We suggest that Kerala Government adopt free software alternatives
such as <https://quicksy.im> which works exactly like WhatsApp from a
user's perspective, but without lock-in to a single company. After
installing the Quicksy app, the user has to provide their phone number
and it is verified by an OTP sent to their phone. It then finds all
users listed in the Quicksy directory matching with the local phone's
address book entries<sup>[5](#fn-5)</sup>. A Quicksy user can
communicate with users of any app or service that uses the XMPP
protocol, not just users of Quicksy app and service. The state
government may easily setup a server on its own and provide this
facility to every student in the state. Apart from Quicksy, there are
other free software alternatives that government may
consider<sup>[6](#fn-6)</sup>.

## Standards and interoperability

XMPP is similar to the SMTP protocol used for email and the GSM
standard used to ensure interoperability between mobile service
providers. A mobile subscriber has the option to buy a SIM card from
any service provider and port their number to a different provider
without losing the ability to talk to their existing contacts if they
are unhappy with the service. In the case of WhatsApp, they have no
choice to move to a different messaging service provider if they want
to talk to other WhatsApp users. So, moving away from WhatsApp is
often not a practical option due to this lock-in. In the case of XMPP,
the users can choose their preferred service provider and change it if
they are not happy with a service provider.

## Recommendations

We would like make following recommedations to the government.

KITE under the Department of Education should be directed to setup
free software based e-learning and communication infrastructure for
state government. This can include instant messaging, file-sharing
systems, and e-learning platforms.

Free software community expertise can be leveraged to setup
infrastructure and train teachers. More than 25 people from the Free
Software community have already volunteered to support the
teachers<sup>[7](#fn-7)</sup>.

Currently the videos are uploaded only on Youtube and Facebook. KITE
should also consider offering PeerTube as another option, which is
Free Software powered and offers better privacy to users. Additionally
it saves cost of live streaming via KITE website by sharing bandwidth
among the users<sup>[8](#fn-8)</sup>. If needed PeerTube instance at
<https://videos.fsci.in> operated by Free Software Community of India
can be used provided the content is licensed under Creative Commons
license which allows sharing freely.

It was noted that the teachers who give classes through first bell
program are recommending proprietary services as tools for
communication. This will create confusion for both students and
parents that they might think they are required for the student's
education. This confusion should be prevented.  

A long-term plan for software and infrastructure adoption should be
discussed. This will help to avoid being depended on proprietary
solutions in an emergency as we will be well prepared. Such
discussions, with the adoption of free software solutions, can design
an advanced, inclusive IT-enabled education system. Free Software
Communities can be involved for support and development of such
system.
