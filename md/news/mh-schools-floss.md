# IT syllabus of  class XI in Maharshtra now includes FLOSS

We are happy to announce that the Maharashtra State Board's IT
syllabus of XI standard is now based on Free/Libre and Open Source
Software (FLOSS). The books have been released in the market. Despite
Ubuntu 18.04 being the default recommended OS, students can choose
their own GNU/Linux distro. The book follows the National Education
Policy in ICT education in order to make the education cost-effective,
ethical and accessible to all. Around 1.5 lakh students in Maharashtra
will be introduced to Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) from
this and successive years.

This is a result of efforts made by veteran founders of ILUG-Bombay,
Krishnakant Mane and his GNUKhata team, Prajakta Patkar, Karan Kamdar
and Abhijit of GNUKhata team.
