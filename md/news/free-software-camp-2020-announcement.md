# Free Software Camp 2020 Launches On Software Freedom Day

The world celebrates Software Freedom Day today with the aim of increasing
awareness of Free Software and its virtues, and it is in the same spirit and
excitement that we announce today the Free Software Camp.

The Free Software Camp is an online mentorship camp on free software organized
by Free Software Foundation of India and Free Software Community of India. It
will start in October and run till end of February.

The Free Software Camp will be a valuable opportunity for anyone who wishes to
become a contributor to free software projects but feels like they need
structured mentorship and a learning environment to get started. It will also be
an opportunity for existing free software contributors to get new contributors
to their project and facilitate their entry into the free software community.

Application links for learners and mentors are open now on the [camp
website][camp-site] and will be so till October 15.

The camp promises to be a safe space for learners to acquaint themselves with
the philosophy of free software while also getting equipped to become free
software contributors. In the first phase of the camp, learners will go through
a series of assignments, interactions, movie screenings, and other activities
that introduces them to the social benefits of free software and exposes them to
the free software culture. They will get help in using free software on their
own devices. At the end of this phase, they will get a chance to explore various
free software projects and working with mentors they will be asked to create
working proposals for contributing to these projects. The camp will match each
learner to a mentor based on their proposal. In the second phase, each learner
starts their free software contribution as per their accepted proposal, closely
working with their mentor. There will be periodic review meetings to address the
needs of the learners and help them stay on track.

Any free software contributor who can meet mentor expectations listed on the
camp site can apply to become a mentor. They can also add their ideas to the
list of ideas from which the learners can find starting points for writing their
proposals. The mentors will work closely with the camp organizers in evaluation
and selection of proposals, and with learners to facilitate the success of the
selected proposals.

The camp encourages all kinds of contributions and contribution pathways -
programming, system administration, packaging, UI/UX, forensics, localization,
artworks, documentation, publicity, event organizing, etc. - as long as there is
alignment with the free software philosophy. The camp is conducted online using
free software communication tools like Big Blue Button, Matrix, etc. There is no
fee for participation.
