# The GNU system has turned thirty years old on September 27, 2013

In 1983, Richard Stallman launched the free software movement with the
words, "Free Unix!" We've freed a lot more than that in the last
thirty years. The GNU system is now a vast universe of fully free
operating systems, window managers, andsoftware that serves almost
every imaginable purpose. More than 95 percent of the world's
supercomputers run free software. A majority of web servers run free
software. Even more impressive, there are estimated to be tens of
millions of free software users worldwide.

That's a lot to celebrate. This weekend, the Free Software Foundation
will be honoring thirty years of GNU with a [celebration and hackathon
in Cambridge, MA][0]. Around the world, there are over [eighteen
celebrations][1] planned on almost every inhabited continent. And
online, people are showing their love for GNU by embedding the
[special 30th anniversary badge][1] on their websites and [donating to
support GNU's future work][2].
