                </header>

                <p>The Free Software Foundation India (FSF India) is a
                    nonprofit organisation committed to advocating,
                    promoting and propagating the use and development of
                    free (swatantra) software in India.</p>

                <p>The special need of free software community in the
                    current historical context.</p>


                <h2>Background</h2>

                <p>As the computer continues to become increasingly
                    pervasive in our personal, social and working
                    lives, the soul of the machine — software — is
                    seemingly trapped in a battle of proprietary
                    ownership.</p>

                <p>In the early days of computing, it was customary for
                    programmers to share software. Since the 1970s,
                    however, much software has become proprietary, such
                    that its users have been prevented from sharing, let
                    alone modifying, programs. By the 1980s, proprietary
                    software had become commonplace, and the computing
                    community was losing the freedom to cooperate in using
                    and altering software. Freedom was under attack.</p>


                <h2>The Free Software Foundation</h2>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>The owners of software had erected walls to divide
                        us from each other.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Those words came from the one person who has
                    zealously campaigned to safeguard software
                    freedoms–Richard M. Stallman, a celebrated
                    programmer and an accomplished hacker. (Contrary
                    to popular belief, a hacker is not an anti-social
                    being. S/he is someone who is passionate, even
                    obsessive, about programming, as opposed to a
                    cracker, someone who breaks security on a system,
                    often with malicious intent.)</p>

                <p>Stallman, then working at MIT’s Artificial
                    Intelligence Lab, left to pursue the Free Software
                    Movement in 1984, inspired by the ideals of
                    American independence: freedom, community and
                    voluntary co-operation, which leads to free
                    enterprise, free speech and free software. He had
                    already started the <a href="https://gnu.org">GNU project</a> in
                    1983 to develop the free operating system GNU (a recursive
                    acronym for GNU’s Not Unix).</p>

                <p>In 1985 Stallman founded the <a href="https://fsf.org">Free
                    Software Foundation</a>
                    (FSF), dedicated to promoting computer users’
                    rights to use, study, copy, modify and
                    redistribute computer programs.</p>

                <p>The FSF promotes the development and use of free
                    software and free documentation. In particular,
                    FSF promotes the GNU operating system, used widely
                    today in its GNU/Linux variant, based on the Linux
                    kernel developed by Linus Torvalds. These systems
                    are often mistakenly called just `Linux’; calling
                    them `GNU/Linux’ corrects this confusion.</p>

                <p>The FSF (<a href="https://fsf.org">fsf.org</a>),
                    whose headquarters is in Boston, Massachusetts,
                    USA, is a tax-exempt charity for free software
                    development. It raises funds by selling GNU
                    CD-ROMs, T-shirts, manuals and deluxe
                    distributions (all of which users are free to copy
                    and change), as well as from donations.</p>

                <p>The FSF also helps to spread awareness of the
                    ethical and political issues of freedom in the use
                    of software. The FSF believes that free software
                    is a matter of freedom, not price.</p>

                <h2>FSF India</h2>

                <p>The Free Software Foundation of India (FSF India),
                    the official Indian affiliate of the FSF, was
                    formally inaugurated by Richard Stallman at the
                    Freedom First! Conference at Thiruvanathapuram,
                    Kerala on 20 July 2001.</p>

                <p>FSF India will be the national agency for the
                    promotion of the use of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free
                    software</a>,
                    i.e. software distributed under the
                    <a href="https://gnu.org/licenses/gpl">GNU General
                        Public Licence (GNU GPL)</a> or
                    <a href="https://gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html">other
                        licences</a>
                    approved by FSF, in all domains.</p>

                <h2>The Vision of FSF India</h2>

                <p>Broadly, FSF India will strive to ensure that free
                    software is strengthened in all respects so as to form
                    a genuine, credible and viable alternative to
                    proprietary software for every kind of application.</p>

                <p>To do so, FSF India will:</p>

                    <li><p>Increase access to free software by users
                        in India.</p></li>

                    <li><p>Promote the development of local solutions
                        to local problems by empowering local
                        programmers in the use of free platforms,
                        tools and technologies.</p></li>

                    <li><p>Provide support to free software by way of
                        documentation, expert help or any other means.</p></li>

                    <li><p>Help organize training for programmers and
                        users of free software platforms and software.</p></li>

                    <li><p>Carry out R&amp;D work for free software
                        solutions to suit local requirements.</p></li>

                    <li><p>Provide services for the free software
                        programmer community by, for example, locating

                        providing a quality assurance mechanism for
                        free software; and ensuring the use of free
                        software in government and quasi-government
                        milieux.</p></li>

                    <li><p>Provide services such as adjudication and
