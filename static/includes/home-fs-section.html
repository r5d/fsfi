                            <p>The free software movement is a world
                                wide effort that campaigns for the
                                creation, use, and adoption of free
                                software.  Free software is a matter
                                of liberty, not price. To understand
                                the concept, you should think of
                                &ldquo;free&rdquo; as in &ldquo;free
                                speech&rdquo;, not as in &ldquo;free
                                food&rdquo;.  We also refer to it as
                                &rdquo;swantantra software&ldquo; to
                                clarify that the software respects
                                your freedom and is not necessarily
                                gratis.</p>

                              <p>Free software entitles users to
                                <a href="//gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">four
                                essential freedoms</a>:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>The freedom to run the program as
                                they wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).</li>

                                <li>The freedom to study how the
                                program works, and change it so it
                                does their computing as they wish
                                (freedom 1). Access to the source code
                                is a precondition for this.</li>

                                <li>The freedom to redistribute copies
                                so they can help others (freedom 2).</li>

                                <li>The freedom to distribute copies
                                of their modified versions to others
                                (freedom 3). By doing this they can
                                give the whole community a chance to
                                benefit from their changes. Access to
                                the source code is a precondition for
                                this.</li>
